Yes. The singleton can be found in the PlayerDamageSingleton script.
Is the singleton implementation properly described?
The singleton is used to modify the player's health. This occurs whenever the player collides with the enemy. When the player collides with the enemy, the player loses a heart. The hearts are located near the top left of the screen.
The enemy gameobject has a collider set to isTrigger. When a collision occurs, the OnTriggerEnter2D function is called which then calls the instance of the PlayerDamageSingleton and calls the appropriate function.
Making the player health a singleton allows any enemies or power ups to easily modify the player's health.
